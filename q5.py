    Represent the VFS as a tree structure in memory.
    Implement commands:
        mkdir <name> to create directories.
        touch <name> to create files.
        rm <name> to delete files or directories.
        mv <source> <destination> to move/rename files or directories.
        ls and pwd commands as in a real file system.
    Add basic read and write operations to virtual files.
